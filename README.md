# Ethereum ToDoList

This project is Blockchain based project where I have created a ToDo List application on the Ethereum blockchain. To read the pending tasks from the list do not cost any Gas. Adding a task or marking a task as complete requires Gas for each transaction made on the blockchain. I have implemented the Project on the personal Ethereum blockchain using Truffle FrameWork and Ganache. I have also used Metamask Chrome extention to integrate the account to perform the transactions on the blockchain involving Gas Price.

The Front page of the application will have a tab to add a new task:

After adding a task we will have to pay the GAS price to commit the changes in the blockchain. We are using metamask chrome extention to pay the GAS price to the local blockchain.

We can complete a task, by clicking on the box of the task. This will also cost us a GAS price as we need to make the changes on the blockchain.
