# Ethereum ToDoList

This project is Blockchain based project where I have created a ToDo List application on the Ethereum blockchain. To read the pending tasks from the list do not cost any Gas. Adding a task or marking a task as complete requires Gas for each transaction made on the blockchain. I have implemented the Project on the personal Ethereum blockchain using Truffle FrameWork and Ganache. I have also used Metamask Chrome extention to integrate the account to perform the transactions on the blockchain involving Gas Price.
